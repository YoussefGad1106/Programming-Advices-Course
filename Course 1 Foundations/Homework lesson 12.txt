Question 1 :

- It is a translator software which is used to convert the high level language to machine language
  it takes the source code and does the building process by checking the errors existence in the whole program and 
  display a message if they are exist else it gives an object code which is linked with the suitable libraries through
  linker and produces an exe file which is executed once you double click it as the progrm is loaded to the memory
  thrrough the loader and the program is launched

Question 2 :

- It is also a translator software which is used to convert the high level language to machine language
  it takes the source code and check every instruction at time and check for errors and if they are not exist
  it executes this instruction and do so with the other instructions

Question 3 :

- It is a translator from assembly language to machine language

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 4 :

- It links the object code with the suitable libraries

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 5 :

- It is an executable file from which the program is launched and the code is executed once you double click it

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 6 :

- It loads the program to the memory to be executed

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 7 :

- Compiled languages are much faster than the interpreter languages

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 8 :

- No, it doesn't generate an exe file

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 9 :

---------------------------------------------------------------------
